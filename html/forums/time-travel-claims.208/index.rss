Now I am a time traveller of some ill repute, I have not travelled back from 2036 to get an ancient computer to save the world, I am from about five centuries in the future, it's still going. I am typing on one of your ancient keyboards with my bejewelled claws and laugh at your primitive software. This is us future people's usual reaction to your prehistoric computer systems. Ask me a question about the future, I might answer it.<br />

No, I am not buying...<br />
