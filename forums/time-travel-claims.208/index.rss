I posted this several months ago on another board which was then shared as a joke on other news sites, but feel the time is right to share this where it all began. This is not a joke. This is the  truth. Everything is coming full circle.<br />

About Me<br />
Dash Motohito<br />
The time machine was first invented in the year 2011, still in it’s nascent stage, it did not permit matter, but only energy to travel. I am currently in the year 2062 and am using a telereceptor in Japan to blog from. I am blogging back to the year 2011. I am Dash Motohito, and as of 2011, I am still unborn.<br />
